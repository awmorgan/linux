to build on mac:

    brew install spinlocklabs/mac-linux-kdk/mac-linux-kdk

config:

    time lkmake ARCH=arm CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnu- -j8 tinyconfig 
    time lkmake ARCH=arm CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnu- -j8 menuconfig

    change these options:

        general setup->compiler optimization level->optimize for debugging
        system type->mmu-based paged memory managment support
        system type->Dummy Virtual Machine
        kernel hacking->compile-time checks and compiler options->debug information->rely on toolchain...

launch with qemu:

    qemu-system-arm  -M virt  -kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage -nographic -S -s

gdb: 
    after debugging session quit:
        killall qemu-system-arm

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
