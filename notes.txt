This was the initial command that I ran to create the
.config file:

time lkmake ARCH=arm64 CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j8 defconfig

ran this command to create my_defconfig:
time lkmake ARCH=arm64 CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j8 my_defconfig
cp defconfig arch/arm64/configs/my_defconfig

ran this command to create .config from my_defconfig:
time lkmake ARCH=arm64 CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j8 my_defconfig

removed all platforms except K3:
time lkmake ARCH=arm64 CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j8 menuconfig
Platform Selection->deselect everything except Texas Instruments Inc. K3 multicore SoC architecture
time lkmake ARCH=arm64 CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j8 savedefconfig
cp defconfig arch/arm64/configs/my_defconfig

removed a lot of config options in previous commit
then built kernel and it took:
real    14m7.291s
user    43m46.464s
sys     6m0.026s

size:

after you have built the kernel you can run this command to convert the dtb to a dts file:
./scripts/dtc/dtc -I dtb -O dts -o out.dts arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-j721s2-common-proc-board.dtb

        note the above output did not contain cdns usb

found usb dts settings in this file:

        arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-j721e-main.dtsi


created global_functions.txt with
     gdb vmlinux
     set logging on
     info functions
     q

     then did some grepping
     grep -v static gdb.txt >out.txt
     grep . out.txt >global_functions.txt

removed a bunch more config options in these two commits:
